                    Local Storage Vs. Session Storage
                </h1>
                <p>
                    <span>Local Storage :</span>This read-only interface attribute allows access to the Document's local
                    storage object; the information is saved across browser sessions. Similar to session storage, with
                    the difference that local storage data is deleted when the browser window is closed or the page's
                    session expires. The last "private" tab in a browser is cleared when it is closed.
                </p>
                <p><span>Session Storage :</span>Access to Session Storage objects is made possible by the read-only
                    sessionStorage attribute. The distinction between the two forms of storage is that data in local
                    storage never expires, whereas data in session storage is erased after a page session finishes.

                <p>
                    <span>Event Loop :</span>If a variable is declared outside of any functions or curly brackets, it is
                    deemed to be defined outside the global scope (). A global variable can be used everywhere in your
                    code, including in functions, once it has been declared.
                </p>
                <p><span>Block Scope :</span>If you declared a variable inside any scope, you can only access a variable
                    that is declared with const or let inside of a curly brace ().

                    <span>Event Loop :</span> The call stack and callback queue tracking is the event loop's main
                    responsibility. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will retrieve the first event from the
                    queue and put it to the Call Stack, where it will then be executed.
